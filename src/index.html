<p>hi, i'm patrik and this is my lil place on the internet</p>

<p>
    this site is my attempt to create a space where I can build my own lil tools and libraries and share things I find interesting with you here on the internet.
    I've been part of this group called <a href="https://agdx.info">agdx</a> since what feels like forever and together we've been redesigning ourselves and the world around us for it to make a little more sense and to be kind to all of it's inhabitants.
    Most of the time I'm doing so by learning how to make stuff myself and sharing what I've learned on this <a href="/blog">blog</a>.
    Other times I'm taking care of my lil off grid place in the real world and logging my progress here.
    Please feel free to stop by my <a href="/bookshelf">bookshelf</a> and browse through books and texts I find inspiring.
